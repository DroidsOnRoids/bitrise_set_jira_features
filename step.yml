  Features and epics list for release notes
summary: |
  Creates a list of features and epics gathered from git commits and tags using given pattern.
description: |
  Feature descriptions are derived from commit messages. List of the features is based on previous commits messages.
  
  The regex pattern to look for features is "<project_prefix>[0-9]{1,5}"
  
  Epics are derived from tags.
  
  The regex pattern to look for epics is "<project_prefix>[0-9]{1,5}_"
  
  An alternative use, would be to create links to appropriate features and epics in the backlog system using the <default_backlog_url> variable.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
